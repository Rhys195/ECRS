This project aims to develop a hybrid recommendation system for ecommerce that combines Content-based Filtering and Collaborative
Filtering methods. Content-based Filtering will analyze product
descriptions and compare them with user profiles to suggest relevant
products, while Collaborative Filtering will use patterns of user behavior
to recommend items that similar users have liked. By integrating these
two methods, the system seeks to provide more accurate and personalized
recommendations, enhancing the overall user experience. The project will
evaluate the system's effectiveness in improving recommendation
accuracy and user satisfaction in an e-commerce setting.
